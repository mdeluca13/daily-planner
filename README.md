# daily-planner

## Description

I developed a daily scheduler to allow myself the ability to schedule my day and have easy color coding to determine what is past, present and future. By developing the JavaScript, I was able to determine what I needed in the HTML and CSS files to ensure my JavaScript runs properly. 

I also learned how to add Day.JS to my project to ensure I was working with the current day and time. 

I was able to use the knowledge base that I have already learned from the Coding Bootcamp as well as research different functions of JQuery and Day.JS to ensure I was using the most efficient code to complete the task at hand.
